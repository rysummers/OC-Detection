# Orbital Cellulitis Detection

## Welcome to my GitHub repository on Using a Convultional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect Orbital Cellulitis.
---

### Objective:
* Apply the fundamental concepts of convolutional neural networks in identifying abscesses in the orbit
* Evaluate and interpret my results and justify my interpretation based on image set
* Create notebooks that serve as computational records and document my thought process. 

The analysis is divided into five sections, saved in juypter notebooks in this repository
1. Project Overview and Objectives
2. Import Libraries and Confirm GPU
3. Data Import and Preprocessing
4. CNN Model
5. Conclusions
6. References
